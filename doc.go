/*
Package gotp is a package for generating and verifying one-time passwords.

It can be used to implement two-factor (2FA) or multi-factor (MFA) authentication methods anywhere that requires users to log in.

Open MFA standards are defined in RFC 4226 (HOTP: An HMAC-Based One-Time Password Algorithm)
and in RFC 6238 (TOTP: Time-Based One-Time Password Algorithm). GOTP implements server-side support for both of these standards.

This is a fork of xlzd/gotp
